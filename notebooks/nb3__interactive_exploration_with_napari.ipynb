    "Welcome to the second half of the workshop! In the first part, Tim showed us how to load, explore, and plot `SpatialData` objects. Now, we're going to start using these tools to perform analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common first step in analyzing a tissue slide is to identify and isolate specific regions of interest (ROIs), such as a tumor area, a healthy region, or an immune infiltrate. In this notebook, we'll learn how to use `napari` to perform this critical task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "1. Use `napari` to manually draw and annotate a region of interest (ROI).\n",
    "2. Use the `polygon_query` function to programmatically select data within our annotated ROI.\n",
    "3. Use this selection to create a new annotation in our `AnnData` table."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Run the cell below to launch `napari`.\n",
    "2. In the `napari-spatialdata` viewer, add the `hires_image` and the `shapes` layers.\n",
    "3. In the annotation panel, color the shapes by the gene `CST3` to see the 'hotspot'.\n",
    "4. In the `napari` layer controls (bottom-left), click the 'Add shapes layer' button (it looks like a polygon).\n",
    "5. Select the polygon tool from the toolbar at the top-left of the layer controls.\n",
    "6. Draw a polygon that encloses the high-expression `CST3` region.\n",
    "7. **Do not close Napari yet!** We will use the viewer object to extract the coordinates of the polygon you just drew."
