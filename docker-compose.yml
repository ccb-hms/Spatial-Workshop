# docker-compose.yml  (FINAL VERSION FOR ATTENDEES)

version: '3.8'

services:
  workshop:
    # This is the most important change. Instead of 'build: .', we point
    # directly to the image you pushed to Docker Hub.
    image: anthonychristidis/spatial-workshop:v1.3

    # The port mapping remains the same.
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"

    # The 'volumes' section is removed. We want attendees to use the
    # notebooks and data that are BAKED INTO the image to ensure 100%
    # reproducibility. This is the simplest and safest approach.
